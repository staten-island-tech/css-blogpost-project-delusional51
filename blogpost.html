        Nice for what is an excelent song on the great album that is Scorpion. Drakes lyricism was very well done on this song as was the beat that was produced by Drake. The song also has a certain "vibe" to it that makes it more appealing to listen to.
        The song's beat, previously mentioned, aids to the listening factor as the 16th notes hi-hats provide an artifical increase to the BPM, which aids to the flow of the song. Another aid to the song is the background vocals by lauryn hill. At around 2:08 the short bridge into the breakdown and the outro
        makes the song even better.
