      <p>Nice For What- Drake</P>

      <p2>
        Nice for what is an excelent song on the great album that is Scorpion. Drakes lyricism was very well done on this song as was the beat that was produced by Drake. The song also has a certain "vibe" to it that makes it more appealing to listen to.
        The song's beat, previously mentioned, aids to the listening factor as the 16th notes hi-hats provide an artifical increase to the BPM, which aids to the flow of the song. Another aid to the song is the background vocals by lauryn hill. At around 2:08 the short bridge into the breakdown and the outro
        makes the song even better.

      <p>Novacane- Frank Ocean</p>
      <img src="novacane.jfif" alt="Novacane">
      <p2>Novacane is such a good song in similar ways to Nice for What, as it excells in its lyrics, beat and flow, the core of all songs. The repition of Novacane in the chorus creates a recognizable sound and flow as it follows the beat of the song.
        The end of the song, where the bridge turns to outro continues the repition however now with "I can't feel a thing" and "I can't feel her".
        The beat itself creaes a slower feeling, with the hi-hats in 8th notes and the four on the floor for the kick drum. The baseline is also very good at slowing down the song in order to focus more on the lyricism.

      <p>See You Again- Tyler the Creator & Kali Uchis</p>
      <img src="see you again.jfif" alt="see see-you-again">
      <p2>The collaborations between Kali Uchis and Tyler the Creator are all great songs, with similar "vibes" and sounds between the two most recent songs (after the storm and see you again). See you Again, in my opinion is the better song however they are both amazing.
      Almost all of the song is sung by both artists, besides the two verses being sung by just Tyler and the final chorus being sung by Kali. The difference in verse two from the rest of the song is start but in great contrast as it compliments the rest of the song very well.</p2>
